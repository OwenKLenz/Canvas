# Simple Paint

This is just a very simple, no frills implementation of the classic Microsoft Paint program.

It's something I've been wanting to try for a while and I was pleased with how quickly it came together. There's definitely room for improvement, and I've already identified a few glaring bugs, but it feels like a nifty proof of concept.

**If I'm feeling adventureous at some point, a few things I might add:**

- The ability to save your drawings (could be with a backend or maybe just using localStorage).
- Adding a "paint can" option to fill regions in.
- Ability to select colors by inputting hexcodes
- "real" line functionality that isn't just a series of dots with a frequency limited by the ability of my browser to process `mousemove` events.
- Other ideas?
